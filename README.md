# hoa_template is a website developed for a friend that is being used for his Homeowners Association. The users use this website to communitate information to all homeowners as well as to collect payment for their HOA dues.

Included is a basic webpage to display information to the visitors and a section to allow them to contact the board members. Once registered and signed in, users can use a control panel for editing their personal information, HOA payments and read news postings. For admin users, they are able to control users (edit, delete, approve), control news post (edit, delete, approve) as well as control and edit various parts of the website (turning website on/off, website name/title/footer, and turning contact form on/off).
